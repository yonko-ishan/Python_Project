# Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption Program

This is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a classic encryption technique used to encode and decode messages by shifting characters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.

## Features

- Encrypts a plaintext message using a Caesar shift
- Decrypts an encrypted message using the same shift value
- Handles non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) by leaving them unchanged
- Allows repeated encryption/decryption in a loop
- User-friendly command-line interface

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a specified number of positions. If the shift moves a character past 'z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.
