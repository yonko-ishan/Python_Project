# Silent Auction Program

This is a simple Python project for a **Silent Auction** game.

Multiple users can place their bids without seeing each otherâ€™s bids. After all bids are placed, the program will display the name of the winner who placed the highest bid.

---

## How it works

- Each user enters their name and bid.
- The screen is cleared (if supported) to keep the next bid hidden.
- Once there are no more bidders, the program finds and shows the highest bidder and their bid.
